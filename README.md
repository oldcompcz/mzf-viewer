# MZF Viewer
A tool for inspecting contents of .mzf files ([Sharp MZ-700 and MZ-800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_MZ) casette tape files).

The tool is primarily designed to inspect fonts and graphics in Sharp MZ-800 games and programs, but can be used to view other files as well (e.g. ZX Spectrum games, see screenshots/cyclone.png).
